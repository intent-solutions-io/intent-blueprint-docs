# 001 - Product Vision and Roadmap

## Vision

Intent Blueprint Docs transforms project ideas into comprehensive, professional documentation in minutes. It is the standard tool for AI-assisted documentation generation, working natively with Claude, Cursor, VS Code, and any MCP-compatible environment.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Speed**: 22 professional documents from a single project description
- **Quality**: Enterprise-grade templates with consistent structure and formatting
- **Flexibility**: CLI, MCP server, IDE integration, and programmatic API
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system, template marketplace, and custom template packs

## Product Pillars

### 1. Template Engine
The foundation: 22 professionally crafted templates covering product strategy, technical architecture, user experience, development workflow, and quality assurance.

### 2. AI Integration (MCP-First)
Native Model Context Protocol integration makes Blueprint a first-class tool for any AI agent or IDE that supports MCP.

### 3. Enterprise Pipeline
Structured 17-question intake with governance controls, CODEOWNERS protection, and CI/CD integration for organizations.

### 4. Ecosystem
Template marketplace, plugin system, and community-contributed template packs for verticals (FinTech, HealthTech, SaaS) and compliance frameworks (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR).
